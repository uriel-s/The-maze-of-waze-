# the maze of waze

 this project represent a **directed whighted graph** and use some algorithms on the graph.
 
 some of the algorithms that are in the project are: 
 
*  isconnected- Returns true if and only if (iff) there is a valid path from EVREY node to each other node.

    ( assume directional graph - a valid path (a-->b) does NOT imply a valid path (b-->a)).

*  shortestPathDistt- a method that calculate the shortest path from given source point to given destination point,

    in form of the lowest total weight. (This**** function's algorithm is base on the Dijkastra algorithm.).


*  shortestPath(int src, int dest) - return a list of nodes that is the shortest way from src to dest.


*  TSP(List targets) - return the short path that include every node in the input list 'targets'.

 
 you can also save and load a graph to and from a file by using the functions in the Graph_Algo class
  
  or using our Gui and click it(save/draw from a file) on the menu in the opened window.
  
  our menu in the Gui window also allow you to show and draw all the algorithms above.
